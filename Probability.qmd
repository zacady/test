# Elements of probability theory

## What is probability?

### Two senses of the term "probability"

Consider the two following statements

> *Statement (1)*
>
> There is 0.95 probability that

> *Statement (2)*
>
> There is 0.5 probability that flipping a fair coin will give me "heads"

### The classical definition

::: {#fig-Box2.1h .infobox style="--c:'Box 3.1';"}
**Classical definition of probability** <br> $$
P(A) = \frac{\#_A}{\#_{total}}
$$ *The probability of A is the ratio between the number of favourable cases to the total number of cases.*

### The frequentist definition

Formulated by John Venn [-@venn1888]

:::: {.content-visible when-format="html"}
::: {#fig-Box2.2h .infobox style="--c:'Box 3.2';"}
**Frequentist definition of probability** <br> $$
P(A) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{n_A}{n}
$$ *The probability of A is the limit of the relative frequency of A as the number of trials goes to infinity.*
